## 📚 Courses Overview

### 🔐 Introduction to Cyber Security
Overview of cybersecurity fundamentals, terminology, key technologies (cryptographic algorithms, protocols, network appliances), and the overall structure of the master’s program.

### 🖥️ Computer Security
Explores authentication, password cracking, access control models (RBAC, ABAC), secure memory, and common software vulnerabilities, with practical techniques for secure coding.

### 🏛️ Information Security Management and Legals
Covers the design and implementation of ISMS systems based on the CIA triad, GRC principles, and PDCA cycle. Includes introduction to GDPR, legal frameworks, and incident response structures like SOC and CERT.

### 🌐 Network Security
Provides an introduction to TCP/IP networks and foundational concepts in securing communications, with practical examples of Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP, and common threats.

### 🔑 Cryptography
Covers symmetric and asymmetric encryption, digital signatures, message authentication codes, and cryptographic hash functions, along with their proper application.

### 🛡️ Security and Threats to Critical Infrastructures
Focuses on ICS/SCADA security, cyber-physical threats, and risk factors in energy, industrial, and smart systems. Includes regulatory frameworks and detection techniques.

### 🔐 Cryptographic Protocols
Studies common security protocols (SSL/TLS, Kerberos, SSH), protection against replay attacks, and an introduction to ECC and blockchain principles.

### 🌐 Web Security
Focuses on application security based on OWASP Top 10, secure development lifecycle, and tools/methodologies for vulnerability detection and mitigation.

### 📋 Information Security & Risk Management
Introduces international standards like ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO 31000, and teaches how to design an ISMS, conduct risk assessments, perform audits, and manage vulnerabilities.

### 🔄 Business Continuity and Crisis Management
Teaches how to define and manage Business Continuity Plans (BCP), including Business Impact Analysis, crisis communication, and incident response.

### ⚖️ Legal Informatics, Privacy and Cyber Crime
Covers cybercrime laws (L. 547/1993), digital evidence, privacy regulations (GDPR), and the legal challenges of digital forensics and cyber investigations.

### 🔍 Fundamentals of Computer Forensics
Introduces digital forensics, evidence acquisition and preservation, forensic imaging, and the NIST digital forensics process model.

### 💰 Cybersecurity in Financial and Credit Systems
Explores cybersecurity challenges and compliance requirements specific to banking and financial infrastructures.

### ⚡ Cybersecurity in SCADA Systems, Industry, Power, and Energy
Comprehensive training on SCADA/ICS security, smart grids, industrial protocols (MODBUS, PMU), and real-world vulnerabilities and case studies.

### 📱 IoT Applications Security
Focuses on IoT device and cloud security, Android Things, and the main risks and best practices for securing modern embedded environments.

### 🧱 Defense-in-Depth Strategies for Critical Infrastructures
Presents multi-layered security strategies and real-world attack examples involving critical infrastructure components.

### 📘 Standards and Best Practices for Security and Safety
In-depth look at security certification standards such as IEC 62351 and ISO/IEC 15408, and the national cybersecurity perimeter regulation (D.lgs. 105/2019).

### 🧠 Social Engineering and Intelligence for Cyber Security
Studies human-centered attack vectors and how to design resilient security systems against manipulation and psychological exploitation.

## 🧪 Final Project – Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration

### 📘 Overview

This repository supports the development of my Master's thesis project in *Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection*, focused on the **integration of a text analyzer into the backend** of a cyber threat intelligence platform.

The work is being carried out as part of a curricular internship and involves understanding, supporting, and extending the backend infrastructure of a Cyber Threat Intelligence System (CTIS), a solution developed by **Leonardo S.p.A.** for advanced threat analysis and response.

---

### 🔍 About the CTIS (Cyber Threat Intelligence System)

Leonardo’s **Cyber Threat Intelligence System** is an advanced platform designed to manage the entire cyber intelligence cycle – from collection to dissemination – within a flexible, scalable, and secure architecture.

#### 🔁 CTIS Intelligence Cycle
The CTIS implements an end-to-end cyber intelligence process structured in five main phases:

1. **Plan & Direct** – Define collection plans and track performance.
2. **Collect** – Ingest threat feeds and structure knowledge using ontologies.
3. **Process** – Convert raw data into actionable intelligence via enrichment and graph modeling.
4. **Analyze** – Visual and API-based threat correlation and investigation.
5. **Disseminate** – Deliver reports and alerts to stakeholders and security systems.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python** – backend logic and integration
- **Docker** – containerized environments
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL document storage
- **REST APIs** – integration with CTIS services

> ⚠️ *Note: The text analyzer module is currently a **work in progress** and will be added to this repository upon further development and testing.*
