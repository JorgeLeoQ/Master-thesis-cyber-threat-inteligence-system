# Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration – Master's Thesis Project

## 📘 Overview

This repository supports the development of my Master's thesis project in *Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection*, focused on the **integration of a text analyzer into the backend** of a cyber threat intelligence platform.

The work is being carried out as part of a curricular internship and involves understanding, supporting, and extending the backend infrastructure of a Cyber Threat Intelligence System (CTIS), a solution developed by **Leonardo S.p.A.** for advanced threat analysis and response.

## 🔍 About the CTIS (Cyber Threat Intelligence System)

Leonardo’s **Cyber Threat Intelligence System** is an advanced platform designed to manage the entire cyber intelligence cycle – from collection to dissemination – within a flexible, scalable, and secure architecture.

### 🔁 CTIS Intelligence Cycle

The CTIS implements an end-to-end cyber intelligence process structured in five main phases:

#### 1. **Plan & Direct**
- Define and manage **collection plans**, intelligence requirements, and analyst tasks.
- Track progress and monitor ongoing intelligence performance.

#### 2. **Collect**
- Aggregate data from **external threat feeds**, **internal security systems**, and **user-supplied sources**.
- Leverage a **customizable ontology** to organize the knowledge base.
- Automate ingestion via **standard formats** (MISP, STIX, YARA, SIGMA) and RESTful APIs.

#### 3. **Process**
- Structure raw data into a **graph-based knowledge model**.
- Perform **automated enrichment** using rule-based playbooks.
- Centralize processing in a unified workspace for all analysts.

#### 4. **Analyze**
- Enable both **manual and automated data analysis**.
- Navigate the knowledge graph visually or via API.
- Produce reports, correlate indicators, and manage threat analysis cases.

#### 5. **Disseminate**
- Deliver **targeted intelligence** to analysts and systems (SIEM, firewalls, EDRs).
- Generate **custom reports and notifications** with “need to know/share” access control.

This structured approach ensures actionable, high-quality threat intelligence tailored to different operational roles.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python** – backend logic and integration
- **Docker** – containerized environments
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL document storage
- **REST APIs** – integration with CTIS services

> ⚠️ *Note: The text analyzer module is currently a **work in progress** and will be added to this repository upon further development and testing.*
